# Reds Win Tracking
Stadtmiller pool to track Reds wins in the 2016 season.

## Rules
* Each player picks a number of wins they think the Cincinnati Reds will have at the end of the 2016 season.
* The winner will be the person who has the guess closest to the actual wins (over or under)
* In the event of a tie, each player entered a tie-breaker value of total steals at the end of the year.

## Display
### Reds data
* display total games played, total wins, total losses, total remaining.
* calculated data: win percentage to date (total wins / total played) 

### Contestant data
* display each player with their guess
* display graphics representing total games, wins, losses, remaining and player's guess.
* display remaining wins needed for player's number to be correct.
* display the "projected" win number (current win percentage * remaining games)
** this is not the best estimator but it's a placeholder until something better - Vegas odds??
* display the "score" - an absolute value of player's guess and projected value. This number should show how close the player is to the Reds projected wins.
* sort players by their score ascending.
