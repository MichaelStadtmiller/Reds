                <h2>These are the rules</h2>
                <p>Each player guesses how many wins the Reds will have at the end of the 2016 regular reason.</p>
                <p>Whichever player is closest to the total Reds wins will win the bet. The winning guess may be
                    under or over the actual wins. (not like The Price is Right rules.)</p>
                <h2>Tie Breaker</h2>
                <p>Each player also guessed the total Reds stolen bases for the year. Whoever is closest
                    (same rules as above) will win the tiebreaker. If this is a tie too, then,  well..

                <h2>Note from the developer</h2>
                <p>Each bar has different colors. This is what they mean:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Green on Left</strong> - Number of games won so far.</li>
                    <li><strong>Red on Right</strong> - Number of games lost so far.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grey in Middle</strong> - Number of games left.</li>
                    <li><strong>Projection %</strong> - Number of wins / number of games played.</li>
                            <small>* This is a pretty bad projection. It will move a lot throughout the season to keep
                            it interesting...</small>
                    <li><strong>Green in Middle</strong> - Wins projected based on current projection %</li>
                    <li><strong>Yellow in Middle</strong> - Your guess</li>
                    <li><strong>Score</strong> - Number of games between your guess (yellow bar) and the wins
                        projected (green bar). Low score wins!</li>
                </ul>
