                <p>Each player guesses how many wins the Reds will have at the end of the 2016 regular reason.</p>
                <p>Whichever player is closest to the total Reds wins will win the bet. The winning guess may be
                    under or over the actual wins. (not like price is right rules)</p>
                <h3>Tie Breaker</h3>
                <p>Each player also guessed the total Reds stolen bases. Whoever is closest (same rules as above)
                    will win the tiebreaker. If this is a tie too, then well, I don't know, call Gil and he'll
                    make something up :)</p>
